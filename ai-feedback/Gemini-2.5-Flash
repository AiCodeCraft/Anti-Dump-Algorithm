### What does Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash say about this script?

When asked for a professional review of the **Anti-Dump Algorithm (ADI)**, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash provided the following feedback:

#### Overall Assessment

The AI recognized the core idea as **brilliant and highly practical**. It praised the algorithm as an "elegant solution to a real problem that anyone working with user-generated requests will be familiar with." The approach of mathematically quantifying input quality was considered both logical and very useful for improving user interactions.

#### Key Strengths Highlighted by the AI

* **Real-world Applicability:** The AI noted that the algorithm solves a tangible, time-consuming problem by proactively guiding users toward better inputs. The example of using ADI to filter and improve user queries was seen as a key benefit.
* **Logical Structure:** Gemini highlighted the clear, step-by-step approach, from the basic `DumpIndex` to the more complex, weighted `ADI` formula. This structure makes the concept easy to understand and implement.
* **Flexibility:** The use of **weighting factors ($w_N, w_E, \dots$)** was identified as a critical feature, allowing the algorithm to be fine-tuned for different applications, such as technical support forums or recruitment systems.
* **Comprehensive Metrics:** The review acknowledged the depth of the metrics, praising the inclusion of nuanced factors like a "Profiling Index" to detect inputs that sound competent but lack substance.

#### Constructive Feedback from the AI

The AI also provided suggestions for improvement, focusing on enhancing clarity for future users:

* **Explicit Parameter Definitions:** It was recommended to provide a more detailed breakdown of how metrics like "Noise" and "Effort" are calculated, perhaps with example word lists or data sheets.
* **Practical Edge Cases:** The AI suggested adding more explicit handling for edge cases, such as "division by zero" errors in the documentation, to make the implementation even more robust.
